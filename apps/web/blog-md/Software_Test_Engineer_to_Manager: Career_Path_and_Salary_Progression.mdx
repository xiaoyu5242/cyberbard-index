# Software Test Engineer to Manager: Career Path and Salary Progression

Breaking through one's technical bottlenecks is not something that can be achieved overnight; it still requires a clear understanding of certain things. Here, I would like to share some experiences and insights with everyone. As a professional in the workplace, I too have my own experiences and stories. During my career, I have had the minor "feat" of receiving 7 pay raises in 2 years (there are many employees who have not received more than 2 raises since joining the company at the same time as me), and I have smoothly progressed from an employee to a testing manager, and finally to a testing director. The increase in salary is secondary; most importantly, I am the fastest-growing and one of the fortunate employees in the company, having avoided some pitfalls and taken fewer detours. However, I am certain that among those who read this article, there will definitely be people who are more outstanding than me. But for those friends who are more eager to achieve breakthroughs and growth, I will share my past growth experiences and insights, and also provide a skill tree that testers need to master for development, hoping to help everyone.

Colleagues often ask me if there is a shortcut to success, and I tell them that the only shortcut is to avoid taking detours. If you achieve the following six points, success is just a matter of time for you.

Be clear about what your future goals are.
Regarding the part about testing technology:

- Why should you learn automated testing?
- As a tester, are you still just clicking around?
- With the same starting point and the same 24 hours in a day, why are your peers leaving you behind?
- Why do some people smoothly pass their probationary period while others are eliminated?
- Why do some people get promoted and receive raises after working for the same amount of time, while others are still clicking around on the front line?
- With the same job content, why do some people finish work and leave, while others work overtime every day and still can't finish?

Many people seem to work hard, but most of them are just using tactical diligence to cover up strategic laziness, and they have already lost at the technical level.

For a technical professional, success in their career is equally important in terms of effort and choice, but before that, passing the technical threshold is the first hurdle.

Otherwise, when opportunities come, you may not be able to seize them just right, and your efforts will only be a low-level repetition.

## Is automated testing difficult or not?

The tools are not difficult, but when it comes to framework design and performance tuning, it is very difficult!

The materials you find online can only barely get you started, and if you want to delve deeper, you can't find a way to learn. Without professional guidance, most people can only scratch the surface and reach a level of understanding that is not quite clear, which is also the current state of most testers in the market.

How to transition from a junior functional tester to a senior test developer, achieving the goal of technical improvement and salary increase, is a phase that many junior testers must go through. As someone who has been through it, I deeply understand the difficulties in the learning process.

During my learning phase, I was keen on collecting and organizing resources, recording the process of falling into and climbing out of pitfalls. I hope to document the technologies, learning methods, insights, and some of the pitfalls I have encountered, which I have learned and used in actual work. I also hope that those of you who want to do automation, like me, can avoid some detours through my sharing, form your own methods, and apply them to practice.

Automated testing is currently more practical in unit testing, but there are still many pitfalls in functional testing in actual operation, and sometimes you need to learn to write scripts to operate the software interface. I have learned about a new automated software testing tool called [Cyberbard](https://cyberbard.co.uk), which can use AI technology to reduce the repetitive work of testers in automated functional testing and improve the efficiency of software testing. It is still under development, and interested friends can [join the waitlist](https://cyberbard.co.uk) to experience it first after it is released.

## Regarding the workplace part

Many people think the workplace is too beautiful, but it is not the case. If you don't plan well, you will inevitably encounter all kinds of problems: being unhappy at work; lacking motivation to move forward; the job is not as good as you imagined; your talents cannot be utilized; seeing how your former classmates are treated, you can't stand the stimulation and are eager to change jobs; the job you found for survival is not suitable for you at all...

These are almost all the problems that new graduates will face when they first enter the workplace. And these problems are usually the most obvious within 1-3 years of entering the workplace (the reason why they are not obvious after 3 years is that you have been tormented by reality for too long, you have been assimilated by all kinds of unfair phenomena, and therefore you are used to it. All your ambitions have been crushed by reality. As a result, you have also changed from an ambitious young person to an ordinary worker who is mediocre, content with mediocrity, and running around for a living every day). If you don't solve these problems in time, then you will waste these 3 years (some people may take longer), and for a newcomer to the workplace, these 3 years are very important, it is the golden 3 years to exercise ability and accumulate capital! Once missed, it will take more time to start over and make up for it again! What's more, some people may never be able to make up for it in their lifetime! This is by no means an exaggeration!

Why is it important to be clear about your goals? Because, with goals, there is a guide for action. Knowing what you want to do and what you like to do is the ultimate driving force for your progress. The root cause of being unhappy at work, lack of motivation, and blind job-hopping is the unclear career goals. Without goals, there is no pursuit, so all actions are just for a meal. You have never considered what kind of job you should have in the future. Perhaps you still have the capital to squander before the age of 30, because you are young, and you are not afraid of anything. Even the advertisements say, "What's there to be afraid of before the age of 30?!" But once you pass 30, every step you take must be very cautious, because: you have to get married, you have to support your wife and children, you have to pay the mortgage, you have to support your elderly parents, your children have to go to school when they grow up, your parents need to be taken care of when they are old... and so on, all these responsibilities, you have to bear. If there is no planning, once a problem arises, you can only panic.

The career development of life is like brand building, only your product is yourself, that is, the brand goal of your life. With goals, you have to consider how to go. Every step should be closer to the goal, not further away. Therefore, when you make a decision, you should measure whether this decision is right or not, and the only standard is: does it help you get closer to the goal? If not, then stop quickly, because the road you are taking has deviated from your goal! If you go on, you can only make a bigger mistake!

A successful career planning is not as simple as determining a goal. Setting goals is only the first step in career planning, and more importantly, it is the implementation. In the process of implementation, various factors will affect. Therefore, for people with different personality types, what advantages, how to play; what weaknesses, how to make up; what mistakes are easy to make, how to avoid; how to build your own knowledge system; how to design your own career growth path, etc., are all within the scope of planning.

## Second, ability is important, but it does not represent everything.

The ability mentioned here refers to soft power. When you enter the workplace, you will find that ability is not as important as you think, and it is not the whole capital for promotion. You will find that a person with not very strong ability has become your boss, just because he has been in this company for 10 years - this shows that "seniority" is your capital for promotion; sometimes you will find that a person with not very strong ability, but with a very good relationship with the boss, can usually be promoted - this shows that "relationships" are also capital. In the company I used to work for, there were two very obvious examples. One of them had rich work experience, and he came to the company, and his ability was also very strong, but he just couldn't get along with colleagues, thought he was very good, liked to take the initiative to be someone else's "mentor", and always pointed fingers at other people's work, and the boss was very disgusted with him; while another lady who entered the company at the same time, her ability was not very strong, but she was very down-to-earth, diligent, and got along well with other colleagues, and could take care of the overall situation. In the end, at the end of the probation period, the lady was recognized by the company, and the man received a dismissal notice from the company.

In the workplace, you must have a clear understanding of the workplace, don't live in a dream, don't be too idealistic, don't be too innovative, don't be arrogant, don't think that ability can go all over the world. Professional skills are certainly important, but career development depends on a person's comprehensive quality. People with high comprehensive quality are the "potential stocks" for career development.

These comprehensive qualities include communication skills, interpersonal skills, teamwork skills, management skills, work attitude, and professional spirit, and various "soft powers". For some students, they may look down on these "soft powers". Many people will say, if the boss likes people who like to flatter, do I have to be wronged and learn to flatter? Unfortunately, I will tell you, the answer is yes, you must learn to flatter, otherwise you will suffer. But it should be stated that I am not teaching you to cheat, flattery also has the art of flattery, not necessarily all "pleasing" or "flattery". There is an old Chinese saying, "round outside and square inside", used in interpersonal communication, which means that you should learn to handle various relationships when getting along with people, but you should not lose your inner principles because of this. Especially in China, which focuses on human relationships, this ability to interact with people must be well practiced. The real master, all kinds of people are not a problem.

Learn to appreciate and praise, and others will also give you flowers and smiles.

## Third, you must have enough "sword" capital.

Some college students often tell me that after graduation, I must find a job with a monthly salary of so much, and strive to achieve what position. At this time, I will always listen to their "great blueprint" patiently, and then ask: "What do you rely on to achieve your goal? What is your capital?" Then he will be speechless. I believe that people who have read this article will also have their own great ambitions like this college student, but after four years of college, have you thought about what your capital is to achieve these goals?

For many students who are already in the workplace, what is your capital for promotion?

In the process of life development, many times you need to show your strength to others without hesitation, dare to show, and be good at showing, this is "drawing the sword". Because nowadays, even the best wine is afraid of deep alleys, and gold may not shine. On the contrary, it is those broken glass and rotten bottles that shine. China lacks everything, but not people. In the vast sea of people, if you have always been modest and obscure, then you are wrong.

Now that you have the consciousness of "drawing the sword", the next step is to consider what sword to draw: what capital do I show to others? For students in the workplace, where is your "sword" capital? Has your performance improved? Has your ability improved? How many books that are beneficial to your career have you read in a year? How many training classes have you attended to recharge yourself? If not, why should the boss give you a raise? By complaining? You will definitely be eliminated from the workplace in advance!

## Four, treat the first job carefully.

This view is more meaningful for college students.

Now the whole society, media, experts and other units have been advocating "first employment, then career choice". This kind of argument is not just this year, but has appeared many years ago, and has appeared repeatedly, endless. I believe that when we graduated from college, many people believed in this point, right? Forget it, ride a donkey to find a horse, first find a job to make money to fill your stomach!

But based on my own experience and the reality of career development, I absolutely do not agree with this view. I believe that students who are not developing well in the workplace now are mostly related to their first job, right? As the saying goes, "men are afraid of entering the wrong industry, and women are afraid of marrying the wrong man." If the first step is wrong, you will often make mistakes in the future. It is just like one step is wrong, and every step is wrong. Why is the first job so important? There are three reasons:

## The concept of first impression is dominant.

It specifically refers to the fact that the words heard first or the impressions obtained first often occupy a dominant position in the mind, and it is not easy to accept different opinions when encountered later. The simplest example is: in your mind, Nokia is already a synonym for mobile phones. What do you feel if one day Nokia produces a "Nokia brand computer"? It's very strange, right? This is the phenomenon of first impression. I used to have a colleague who used to work at Haier, and she used a Haier mobile phone, which was also very good in function, but she always said she wanted to change a mobile phone. I asked her why, and she said that carrying a Haier mobile phone in her pocket always felt like carrying a big refrigerator, which was very uncomfortable. Why? It's the first impression! Don't underestimate this phenomenon, it actually has a great influence on people's subconscious. The poor sales of Haier's mobile phones and computers and other IT products are partly due to the first impression: people generally believe that Haier is a synonym for home appliances, not IT.

For job-seeking college students, this concept will also affect your future development. Your first job will affect your future work, and when you change jobs, your new employer will also judge whether you can be competent for this job through your first work experience. There was a college student who wanted to do planning after graduation and found an advertising company. When he first entered the company, he was arranged in the copywriting position because of his good writing skills, while another person who entered the company at the same time was arranged in the planning position because of his poor writing skills. Later, she tried to change her career to planning many times, but she never got the opportunity to change her career due to the influence of her previous work experience.

## The workplace does not allow starting over.

If the company recruits experienced employees, it must require "relevant experience"! This point is very important! Because such employees generally do not need training and can go to work directly, which will bring the greatest benefits to the company as soon as possible. If you want to change your career after working for a few years, you will generally not be valued, one is that you will not bring direct benefits to the company, and the other is that it is more difficult to train, and your thinking has been solidified. It's better to recruit a fresh graduate, a blank sheet of paper, with strong plasticity and greater potential for development. Therefore, once you have work experience, it is quite difficult to change your career and start over. Unless you know the company's senior leaders and can get an opportunity, otherwise, it is very difficult.

## Time cost does not allow.

The first three years of entering the workplace is the most important and critical period for a person's career growth. If you still focus on changing careers like riding a donkey to find a horse at this time, you will waste your most precious youth, and your growth will be slower than others, and many promotion opportunities will be lost as a result.

## Five, maintain an "empty cup mentality".

The most direct meaning of "empty cup mentality" is that a cup filled with water is difficult to accept new things. You need to empty the "cup" in your heart, completely clear the past from your mentality, and the things you care about and the brilliant past. Only by emptying your heart can you have an external let go, and you can have greater success.

This is the most important mentality that everyone who wants to develop in the workplace must have. It tells us a truth: the premise of doing things is to have a good mentality first. If you want to learn more knowledge, you must first imagine yourself as "an empty cup", not arrogant and complacent.

I have seen many college graduates who often boast everywhere when they first enter the company, saying how they were in school, how they could have found a better job, and reluctantly came here and so on, as if this company has wronged them. Here is a reminder to those college students who are about to enter the workplace: this mentality must not be obtained! Don't think you are great. It's still that sentence you don't like to hear: China lacks everything, but it doesn't lack people! On the other hand, if you are so great, why don't you drop out of school like Bill Gates, Dell, and Jobs, and start a world-class enterprise? The train is not pushed, and the cowhide is not blown. If you have the ability, use the facts to prove it to others, instead of complaining all day!

For students who have just entered the workplace, this mentality is also very important. There is a word in China, called "hollow and valley". We all know that excellent people have a very high quality, and they all have a tolerance to contain everything. With such a tolerance, you will gain the respect of others in the workplace and more development opportunities.

## Six, opportunities only favor the prepared.

No matter how much you complain, no matter how unhappy you are, you still have to eat, sleep, and work. The future is always your own. Whether it's buying a house or marrying a wife, the pressure is on you, and the boss won't care about you at all.

Instead of having time to complain, it's better to calm down and improve your ability. Use facts to prove your ability and let others look at you with new eyes. You must not be a "angry youth" who destroys his future because of his own bookishness.

Of course, your preparation is multifaceted. In addition to professional skills, other auxiliary skills are also very necessary, such as communication skills, interpersonal relationship processing skills, management skills, etc. Of course, more importantly, you should make a plan for your future, clearly know what your goals are, and how to work hard to achieve them. At the right time, you should also recharge, and don't be reluctant to give up half a month's salary. This is also an investment in your future. What's there to be reluctant about? If you don't learn to "give up" now, you will never "get" it in the future.

Sometimes, the reason why you don't develop well is not that there is no opportunity, but that you are not prepared, which leads to the opportunity passing you by. This society is like this. No matter how unreasonable or unfair it is, development opportunities are faced at all times, and it depends on whether you are prepared. If you really have a set of real skills that make people look at you with new eyes, maybe someone will invite you to be the president of a Fortune 500 company tomorrow. (Of course, this is a joke)

Everyone knows that the demand for automated testing positions in Internet companies is increasing day by day, but there is a shortage of qualified testing engineers on the market, and it is difficult to find a good one; on the other hand, a large number of testing engineers are still engaged in the most basic work, with a meager salary, eager to transform, eager to enter the Internet company, but they are wandering and confused and don't know which direction to choose.

## Our goal is creating more value for the company

The above is a knowledge structure system that I have organized for everyone's software testing engineer development direction. I hope everyone can complete the construction of such a system in 3-4 months according to this system. It can be said that this process will make you miserable, but as long as you get through it, life will be much easier in the future. As the saying goes, everything is difficult at the beginning, as long as you take the first step, you have already succeeded half. Our goal is not to become a testing manager or to increase our salary, that is just the result, creating more value for the company is our value. When you look back on this journey after completion, you will definitely have a lot of feelings.
